# Catalog

The license catalog exists to solve the following issues:

* Works that cannot reasonably bear an obvious license notice due to their file format
* Non-software works for which the main software license is inappropriate
* Works that require attribution for which the original commit does not belong to the work's originator

Attribution of modifications is considered to be inherent in the git history.  Record the original source for works that are brought in under CC-BY-* licenses etc and then rely on git history to attibute modified versions.

As mentioned on the contributor agreement, all documentation is CC-SA 4.0 licensed so that we may bring derived 3rd party documentation improvements back into the project.

## Updates

For each item, indicate the file path from the root of the repository, and then the license type.

To avoid any uncertainty about who created a work and their authority to license it, please use one commit for both the work and the catalog entry.

## Licenses

A copy of the license's text must be in this folder prior to using a license.
